This second-generation Onion Routing system addresses limitations in the original design by adding perfect forward secrecy, congestion control, directory servers, integrity checking, configurable exit policies, and a practical design for location-hidden services via rendezvous points. Tor works on the real-world Internet, requires no special privileges or kernel modifications, requires little synchronization or coordination between nodes, and provides a reasonable tradeoff between anonymity, usability, and efficiency. We briefly describe our experiences with an international network of more than 30 nodes. We close with a list of open problems in anonymous communication.},

	title = {The {Onion} {Routing}},
	abstract = {Onion Routing is basically an infrastructure to maintain anonymity over the public network as its functionality provides features against eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Every piece of identifying information is carried within data streams over an anonymous connection. The network provides anonymity to both clients and servers, functioning as a 'black box' that hides the routing information of network participants. This document also provides a historical view of the anonymity systems. An in-depth study of the TOR(The Onion Router) system is also conducted examining its development, its features, its limitations and its weaknesses. The method used to locate any TOR identifying markers is via a packet comparison of TOR and non-TOR identical network packets. Recommendations are given regarding the usage of TOR to mitigate the behavioral actions of users that have inadvertently violated their anonymity.},

	abstract = {The Tor anonymous communication network uses selfreported bandwidth values to select routers for building tunnels. Since tunnels are allocated in proportion to this bandwidth, this allows a malicious router operator to attract tunnels for compromise. Since the metric used is insensitive to relative load, it does not adequately respond to changing conditions and hence produces unreliable performance, driving many users away. We propose an opportunistic bandwidth measurement algorithm to replace selfreported values and address both of these problems. We also propose a mechanisms to let users tune Tor performance to achieve higher performance or higher anonymity. Our mechanism effectively blends the trafﬁc from users of different preferences, making partitioning attacks difﬁcult.},

	abstract = {The transformation of the contemporary societies through digital technologies has had a profound effect on all human activities including those that are in the realm of illegal, unlawful, and criminal deeds. Moreover, the affordances provided by the anonymity creating techniques such as the Tor protocol which are beneficial for preserving civil liberties, appear to be highly profitable for various types of miscreants whose crimes range from human trafficking, arms trading, and child pornography to selling controlled substances and racketeering. The Tor similar technologies are the foundation of a vast, often mysterious, sometimes anecdotal, and occasionally dangerous space termed as the Dark Web. Using the features that make the Internet a uniquely generative knowledge agglomeration, with no borders, and permeating different jurisdictions, the Dark Web is a source of perpetual challenges for both national and international law enforcement agencies. The anonymity granted to the wrong people increases the complexity and the cost of identifying both the crimes and the criminals, which is often exacerbated with lack of proper human resources. Technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence come to the rescue through automation, intensive data harvesting, and analysis built into various types of web crawlers to explore and identify dark markets and the people behind them. It is essential for an effective and efficient crawling to have a pool of dark sites or onion URLs. The research study presents a way to build a crawling mechanism by extracting onion URLs from malicious executables by running them in a sandbox environment and then analysing the log file using machine learning algorithms. By discerning between the malware that uses the Tor network and the one that does not, we were able to classify the Tor using malware with an accuracy rate of 91\% with a logistic regression algorithm. The initial results suggest that it is possible to use this machine learning approach to diagnose new malicious servers on the Tor network. Embedding this kind of mechanism into the crawler may also induce predictability, and thus efficiency in recognising dark market activities, and consequently, their closure.},

Existing onion service analysis methods cannot be used any more to understand V3 onion services and the ecosystem such as benign services, abuses and black markets. To understand the scale of V3 onion services, we theoretically analyze the V3 onion service mechanism and propose an accurate onion service size estimation method, which is able to achieve an estimation deviation of 2.43\% on a large-scale emulated Tor network. To understand onion website popularity, we build a system and collect more than two years of data of public onion websites. We develop an onion service popularity estimation algorithm using online rate and access rate to rank the onion services. To reduce the noise from the phishing websites, we cluster onion websites into groups based on the content and structure. To our surprise, we only find 487 core websites out of the collected 45,889 public onion websites. We further analyze the weighted popularity of each group using yellow page data and discover that 35,331 phishing onion websites spoof the 487 core websites.},

It provides a low-latency, circuit-based, bidirectional secure channel between two parties through a network of onion routers, with the aim of obscuring exactly who is talking to whom, even to adversaries controlling part of the network. Tor relies heavily on cryptographic techniques, yet its onion encryption scheme is susceptible to tagging attacks (Fu and Ling 2009), which allow an active adversary controlling the first and last node of a circuit to deanonymize with near-certainty. This contrasts with less active traffic correlation attacks, where the same adversary can at best deanonymize with high probability. The Tor project has been actively looking to defend against tagging attacks and its most concrete alternative is proposal 261, which specifies a new onion encryption scheme based on a variable-input-length tweakable cipher.},
